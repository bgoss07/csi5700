IPFS implementation in Google Cloud compute instances

This work is a course project completed in December of 2023. It was a group effort conducted by myself and three other classmates AS, JD, & JJ. 
The point of this project was to look at resilience of instances to high traffic. We used Locust to simulate this traffic. 
We also used IPFS gateways to connect the content to HTTP - compatible browsers. 
It's unlikely we will leave the actual websites up past December 30, 2023, but if this can help save someone a little bit of time set up a personal IPFS configuration, then it's worth it. 

You'll see the configuration used for IPFS in code.sh with a lot of the tips I learned the hard way. If you have any questions about the material, please leave an issue and I'll help as best I can. 

I only hosted a static webpage. There's some reference in docs.ipfs.io that may be able to help. 

Good luck!
